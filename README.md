# Tensorflow-Keras-Tutorials
Tensorflow and Keras tutorials for convolution networks and RNNs using a variety of datasets, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, and ImageNet.

## 1. CNN MNIST Tutorial in Keras (with hidden-layer visualization)

In this tutorial, I cover the basics of implementing several convolution and fully-connected networks in Keras, using the MNIST dataset. This tutorial will allow you to compete in the Kaggle MNIST challenge, and better understand convolution networks by viewing some of the hidden layer outputs.

## 2. MNIST Vectorized Linear Regression in Numpy/Python

In this tutorial, we will implement the "backpropogation" algorithm for simple linear regression on MNIST, first by looping over the weights, and then using a vectorized implementation in Numpy. We will talk about the calculus of Stochastic Gradient Descent, and prepare of a logistic regression implementation in the next tutorial. For anyone interesting in actually doing Machine Learning by hand, without a framework, or in understanding what Tensorflow is actually doing, this should be helpful.
