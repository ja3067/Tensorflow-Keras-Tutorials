# Tensorflow-Keras-Tutorials
Tensorflow and Keras tutorials for convolution networks and RNNs using a variety of datasets, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, and ImageNet.

## 1. CNN MNIST Tutorial in Keras (with hidden-layer visualization)

In this tutorial, I cover the basics of implementing several convolution and fully-connected networks in Keras, using the MNIST dataset. This tutorial will allow you to compete in the Kaggle MNIST challenge, and better understand convolution networks by viewing some of the hidden layer outputs.
